# Roadmap & Todos

The following features are some ideas how this visualization extension could be improved:

**Media type _HTML_**
- [ ] Allow definition of an external style-sheet

**Media type _Website_**
- [ ] Allow the user to select the [security settings for the embedded website](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp) (now hardcoded)
- [ ] Display an error if a website doesn't allow to be embedded, e.g. http://www.google.com

**Media type _Video_**
- [ ] Support for a video type _YouTube_
- [ ] Support for a video type _Vimeo_
- [ ] Support for a video from the media library
- [X] Support for a preview image

**Actions**
- [ ] Allow actions for all media types (e.g. jump to sheet, open application, etc.)

Any further ideas, please let me know!
